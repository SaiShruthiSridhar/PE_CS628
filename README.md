Repository for my Programming Exercises for CS628

Input: 
The application is given an array of movies that are categorized by the title, genre, and the release year of the movie.

Process:
JavaScript converts movie data into an improved format. It is in the form of a dropdown list where you make your genre choice and then only the movies in that genre will appear.  The movies are presented in form of a colored card and when a card is clicked, the title of the movie appears in an alert box.

Output:
The app displays the list of movies that could be filtered by the genre through the dropdown. The movies are shown as cards which can be clicked. The design is clean, colorful and a little different when you hold the mouse on a card.
